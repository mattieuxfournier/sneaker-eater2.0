        <div class="blogtxt1"><p>I’ve been stuck on level 3 for everrrrrrrrr! But I can’t stop playing! This game is so fun and satisfying. I love the fast pace action and excitement I get every time I hop on the game. Playing this game never gets boring because every level is unique in its own way. Plus their website has all the tips you need to get you started if you’ve never played before. Something I would like to see in the game soon is easter eggs hidden around the levels. Besides that great game!</p></div>
      <div class="blogtxt1"><h3>Sneaker Eater</h3><p>Thanks for the feedback, but there are already easter eggs hidden. Have fun finding them!

        <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
        <h5>Add a leaderboard, May 29, 2022</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src="leader.jpg" alt="" class="img"></div>
        <div class="blogtxt1"><p>I have over 100 hours on this game and have completed it countless times but it never gets boring. At first I was struggling and had to look at online tips but I found them all on their super well organized website. Now that I’m a pro, I try to see how fast I can complete the game and beat my personal record. The point system in the game is very useful but I think a great addition to the game would be a global leaderboard with the fastest times and highest scores from everyone that plays the game.
        </p></div>
      <div class="blogtxt1"><h3>Sneaker Eater</h3><p>Thanks for your suggestion,that is a very good idea and we’l certainly consider adding it in the future.
